Cipher Simulation Project

This repository contains a Python-based simulation project that explores various encryption techniques, focusing primarily on substitution ciphers. The project includes:

    Implementations of multiple cipher algorithms, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt messages.
    A graphical user interface (GUI) that enhances user interaction and makes the encryption process intuitive.
    Detailed documentation to guide users through the functionalities and usage of the application.

Whether you're a beginner looking to understand the basics of cryptography or an enthusiast wanting to experiment with different cipher methods, this project provides a comprehensive starting point.
